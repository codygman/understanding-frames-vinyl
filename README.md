Understanding Frames and Vinyl
============================================

I made a [library augmenting Frames](https://github.com/codygman/frames-diff) for some of my use cases.

I got pretty far with the help of @acowley and [#haskell on Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/haskell).

I still don't feel like I fully understand everything though, so I inlined all code necessary from both Frames and Vinyl to create a lens for a userId in a simple User Record and this is the result.

I hope to later go line by line and explain pieces to myself and detail, hopefully the result will be useful to others as well.
